Mobile Development tower defense game team - 21461A

Hey guys, 

welcome to our project repository

This git repository will allow us to easily update and add the assignment through out development
and it will allow us to have easy and consistant version control for development sprints.

If there is something that needs to be added to the project please create an issue(even if you are going to complete is yourself)
this will allow us to see what the project should be able to do at every stage and allow us to see what needs to be done.

Remember to give a descriptive response as to what you have changed when you push a new version of the project onto the repository.

Remember, please dont edit existing code unless your can ensure that the output of the code you are editing outputs the same values. Adding new code will cause less bugs than editing other peoples code.

If you need any help familiarising yourself with git hub feel free to email me

-Jon
